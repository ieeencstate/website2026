11/12/2025 Major Changes in refactoring files
- Changed code base from ts to react
- changed src root directory to app root directory
- Made visual chnages(like a lot of visual changes)
- Kept template code Ohm made, just need to turn it into react
- Need to setup database for contact and signing up club
- Template files folders kept: Awards, gallery, resources, scholarship. However, I did not connect them to nav yet since theres an internal bug : "null is not an object (evaluating 'root.querySelectorAll')" which is caused by navabar so im doing some error handling
